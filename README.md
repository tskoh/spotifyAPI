# spotifyAPI
A single class for a sandbox playground for Spotify APIs.

This code gives a demonstration of the API requests: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This demonstration will work with Spotify playlist manipulation.
By running the code the user will select a number from 1 to 4 to execute a request: 1 - GET; 2 - POST; 3 - PUT; 4 - DELETE

You can go to https://developer.spotify.com/ to take a look at their APIs.
